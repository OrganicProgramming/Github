- 👋 Greetings traveler, welcome to the land of peace and parens.
- 🌱 I am learning Common Lisp (CL) for about a year now, because this language allows me to program towards the API of my choice with maximal speed and interactivity
- 👀 I am currently interested in automating brain damaging day-to-day tasks with intuitive and simple code. For now, I would like to make Excel data easily accessible from CL e.g. to dump an Excel file into a sqlite database for quick analysis.

- ðŸ‘‹ Greetings traveler, welcome to the land of parentheses.
- ðŸŒ± I am learning Common Lisp (CL) for about a year now, because this language allows me to program towards an arbitrary API of my choice with maximal speed and interactivity.
- ðŸ‘€ I am currently interested in automating day-to-day tasks with intuitive and simple code. For now, I would like to make Excel data easily accessible from CL e.g. to dump an Excel file into a sqlite database for quick analysis. At present,I cannot find any CL library with an API that fits my needs. In particular, I would like to be able to easily connect CL variables to headernames of a given Excel row and process Excel files of large sizes on a row-by-row basis.
